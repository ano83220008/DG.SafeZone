# DuckGame.TemplateMod

# How to build

Put this repo in your Duck Game's mods folder like this: `DuckGame/Mods/Template/mod.conf`

Copy Duck Game's exe into the `ThirdParty` folder ( I couldn't be arsed to use an ENV variable so make do with this )

Then just build it and Duck Game should pickup the dll with the same name as the folder, if the name differs it will NOT load.
